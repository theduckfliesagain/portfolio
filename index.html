    <h1>Hi, I'm Rishi.</h1>

    <h3>A bit about me</h3>
    <p>I'm a physics graduate from the University of Warwick who loves learning new technologies. 
    Alongside developing my coding skills in languages such as Python and C#, 
    I'd like to learn more web orientated tools such as Javascript and React. </p>
